## Reporting a Vulnerability
We take the security of Haly seriously and appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any potential vulnerabilities. If you discover a security issue, please follow these guidelines:
- **Step 1:** Submit a detailed report of the vulnerability to our security team by emailing support@haly.ai. Please include the steps to reproduce the vulnerability, any relevant code snippets, and any other information that would help us understand and reproduce the issue.
- **Step 2:** Our security team will review your report and respond to you within 48 hours to acknowledge receipt and provide any additional information or clarifications if needed.
- **Step 3:** We will work with you to verify and reproduce the vulnerability. Once we have confirmed the issue, we will prioritize it and provide you with updates on our progress.
- **Step 4:** Once the vulnerability has been addressed, we will work with you to determine the appropriate disclosure timeline and credit you for your responsible disclosure.
We kindly request that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had a chance to address it and provide a fix. We are committed to resolving security issues promptly and will keep you updated on our progress throughout the process.
Thank you for helping us keep Haly secure! We appreciate your collaboration in maintaining the integrity of our project.
